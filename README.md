## About the project

This a small test project to demonstrate my skills with Laravel, Inertia and Vue 3.
Specific versions:
- Laravel Framework: 8.83.14
- Inertia - Laravel: 0.5.4
- Vue.js: 3.2.31


I didn't face a lot of issues as this is very basic project. I didn't focus too much on the frontend because I didn't have that much time.

### Timemeline

I think this project took about 10-15 hours.

### Commands for running:
- `composer install`
- `php artisan key:generate`
- `php artisan migrate` - after you create a DB and update .env
- `php artisan serve`
